<h1>Oh One Pro</h1>

Hi, I'm Daniel and I build [AI apps](https://boltai.com?utm_source=ohonepro) ðŸ‘‹

Oh One Pro is a free utility that allows you to analyze documents using ChatGPT o1-pro and o3-mini models.

OpenAI's o1-pro is very powerful. But it doesn't support Document Analysis yet. You can't upload PDFs, source code, or other documents when using o1-pro.

Oh One Pro works around this by converting your documents to xml or images so you can use with o1-pro.

## Features

- Floating panel interface for quick access
- Global keyboard shortcuts
- Menu bar integration
- Document processing capabilities
- Modern macOS design

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later (for development)

## Installation

### From Source
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/boltai/OhOnePro.git
```
2. Open `Oh One Pro.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run the project

## Usage

It's incredibly simple to use.

1. Drag and drop your files into the app or the Dock icon
2. Copy as text (xml format) or images
3. Paste into ChatGPT app
